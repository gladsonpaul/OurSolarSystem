            <p>The Sun holds the solar system together, keeping everything – from the biggest planets to the smallest
                debris – in its orbit. <br> <br> The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun’s volume
                would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping
                everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it.</p>

            <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than
                Earth's Moon.<br> <br>Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar
                system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.</p>
